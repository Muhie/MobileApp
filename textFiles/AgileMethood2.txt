Who uses the agile methood?
Today, Agile is used by more than just software teams. The tenets of Agile are effective for projects that result in a concrete deliverable rather than a service. However, Agile can ultimately be used on almost any large scale project in any industry. 
Any of these project teams can benefit from using Agile: Teams handling fast-changing deliverables, such as technology products Teams working on projects that evolve or do not have clear scope and requirements at the beginning; Teams working closely with customers and other external parties throughout a project; Teams that emphasize process and product improvement and need a method for continual advancement; Teams with numerous interdependent tasks needing to work closely together and frequently communicate to ensure success ; Teams creating prototypes before building the final project outcome; Teams that must have rapid feedback from each product iteration before creating the next draft.
