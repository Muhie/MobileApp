What are Software Development Lifecycles?
When developing a solution to a problem for a computer system, developers go through a number of distinct phases. This is known as a software development lifecyle. The arangement of these phases and how developers move form one phases to anothboth forwards and backwards is know as the software methodology or model.
These stages include: Feasiblity, Requirments, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Evaluation, Maintenance.
Feasiblity: Is this problem even solvable?
Requirments: Working out what the solution needs to do.
Analysis and Design: Working out how the solution needs to do it.
Testing: Checking if the code actually works.
Deployment: Installing it into the target enviroment.
Evaluation: Checking with the user - is the solution complete.
Maintenance: Ensuring it continues to function properly after Deployment and patching and updating it if not.
