The Waterfall Model.
The waterfall model derives its
name from its cascading effect from
one phase to another.
Each phase has a well-defined start
and end point with identifiable
deliverables.
A slight evolution of the waterfall
model allows you to move back to a
previous stage as well as forwards-
this reflects the fact that developers
often have to rework earlier stages
in light of knowledge gained as
development progresses.
