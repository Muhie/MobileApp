Agile Methood!
Agile development refers to a group
of methodologies (not a single one)
that came about in the early 2000s.
These methodologies focus on the
idea that requirements will shift and
change during development-this
can only be dealt with by producing
software in an iterative way.
They are a more refined form of the
older concepts.
