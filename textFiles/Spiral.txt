The Spiral Model.
The spiral model is a risk-driven
development methodology. Any
project has its own set of unique risks
associated with it.
The spiral model is more of a guide for
development teams, allowing them to
adopt elements of one or more other
methodologies or models like waterfall or Agile.
It is a common misconception that the
spiral model is a fixed process that
must be followed in the correct order.
In reality, it is wholly dependant on the
project and its unique risks.
This model is better thought of as a
process model generator, where
decisions on the software development
methodology are made based on the
risks identified.
